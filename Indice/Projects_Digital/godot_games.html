<h2 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'lato', sans-serif">My 3D and 2D Godot games</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  As this is my first project i'll be writing about, for anyone who is reading this, please pardon how horribly i might go and phrase this
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  From the moment i started programming on a simple Arduino uno board, i felt like i was getting closer to my dream profession. Even if i was not all that great at
  programming itself, i tried and tried left and right. In those same years, i self taught myself C# and Lua. It was tough, since i had never really "programmed" before
  , but i eventually got the hang of it! Kinda... <br>
  One day, my friend N invited me into a project of his invention, making a video game! I think he eavesdropped that i've been meaning to make games for a long time, so Carpe Diem i guess!
  The project got eventually dropped into hiatus, since we both started Uni, but this sparked a great innovation in my mind.<br>
  I could finally fulfill my childhood dream of making a website, and Godot was the key for it!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  But enough backstory, what about these games?<br>
  The 2D one is a simple farming game, not gonna go much in details for now as most of it is up in the air; but since i've always lived in a rural area my whole life,
  i feel like i can make something a little different from what the market of farming games has now (i know about the overbloat of farming games in the market, i know it's a dangerous move, idc :])
  <br><br>
  The 3D one is even more abstract than the 2D one. I have the ideas to make it, but i still need to ponder further on what i REALLY want and just generally organize it a bit..
</p>

<p>
  My colleague (not N), who is responsible for basically 99.999% of the art in the aforementioned games, also has ideas for games he'd like to develop! Idk if he wants
  me to disclose them as of now, so i'll probably update this page, both with news from my games, and eventually his (only if and how he wants to).
