<p style="text-align: justify">
  As of the 10th of june 2025, i have finally released my first Godot game for the Spaghetti Game Jam hosted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@yotobi" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'lato', sans-serif;text-decoration: none">Yotobi</a>.
  It's a demo though, since i had barely enough time to develop and work the game out with my friend between exams and whatnot. It's available on <a href="https://prismatic-mind.itch.io/disturbance-interference" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'lato', sans-serif;text-decoration: none">Itch.io</a>, free download (of course, it's a demo, duh) and safely tested by Yotobi himself.

  I am nearing the completion of a "prototype" of a game, though i must admit that blender modelling is truly harder than i initially thought. I was considering either posting it here
  or on me and my colleague's tiktok account as a sort of devlog, or perhaps even create a yt channel for Prismatic Mind and upload it there. Thoughts? i know people cant really (yet)
  leave comments on my site as it is in construction, but i am interested in seeing how many views my website gets as a sort of metric to see if i have any online relevance. I'll see how to track such metrics soon.
