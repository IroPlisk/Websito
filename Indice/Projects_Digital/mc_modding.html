<p style="text-align: justify">
  Here i relay all my efforts of modding minecraft throughout its versions
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;font-weight: bold;line-height: 0;font-size: large">Miner's Bouquet - 09/01/2026</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  I have a project in hiatus (because of exams mostly) called "Miner's Bouquet", a 1.19.2 minecraft mod that would ad a bunch of additions to the floral part of minecraft,
  that i always felt a bit lackluster beyond the "get the plant dye or decorate, that's it". It would include a way to cultivate some custom flowers, make a bouquet, yadda yadda.
  Problem is that due to exams and a creativity shortage i had to put it on hiatus. I definitely do want finish it and publicize it, so it's on my todo list, although on a rather low priority.

<p style="text-align: left;font-weight: bold;line-height: 0;font-size: large">Gastronomod 2 - 11/11/2024</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  I have been working on an updated, "better" version of Gastronomod (rgbcraft), to provide to rgbcraft as some sort of way to enhance the food system that in minecraft 1.4.7 was really barren.
  Unfortunately, to no one's surprise, i was both a newbie in CS, and the documentation (although provided gracefully by rgbcraft's owner) was not that descriptive as modern documentations are. Understandable minecraft modding was
  still a rather new concept back in 2013, minecraft had gone out of beta barely 3 years earlier.
